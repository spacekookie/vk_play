# Vk Play

A small repository for my quest to learn the Vulkan API. The first example will just be a simple triangle application built from a tutorial. Later additions might include the usage of certain Vulkan powered frameworks (such as Anvil).


## How to build

You can build the project with cmake. You will need `vulkan`,  `glfw` and `foo` to compile this project

```console
$> mkdir build && cd build/
$> cmake .. && make -j 2
```


If you find any bugs in these examples, please report them. Thank you.
